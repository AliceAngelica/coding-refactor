# Coding refactor of Horiseon Webpage

## Description
The aim of the project was to refactor the code of the Horiseon Marketing website without interfering with the styling of the page. The refactor aimed to increase the accessibility of the page for those with a disability, and to improve the readability of the code.

## Usage
To increase the accessibility of the code non-semantic HTML (such as div tags) were replaced with semantic HTML elements, this enables individuals using a screen reader (or other equipment) to navigate through the various sections of the page without difficulty. Images were also provided with descriptions. To improve the readability of the code, much of the unnecessary and repetitive CSS selectors were removed whilst maintaining the original design. Comments were also included throughout the HTML and CSS documents, making the code easier to understand.
