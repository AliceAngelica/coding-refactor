# Coding refactor of Horiseon Webpage

## Description
The aim of the project was to rework the code on the Horiseon webpage in order to improve the readability of the code, and most importantly increase its accessibility. 

## Usage
To improve the readability, much of the unnecessary and repetitive CSS selectors were removed whilst maintaining the original design. Undescriptive div tags were replaced with semantic HTML to help individuals using a screen reader navigate through the various sections of the page. Images were provided with descriptions to improve accessibility.
